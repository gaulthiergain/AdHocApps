# ChatAdHoc

This chat application is a proof a concept application for the _adhoclib_ [library](https://github.com/gaulthiergain/AdHocLib). 

It allows multiple mobiles to communicate directly with each other without using a centralized architecture. This application handles all types of communication (Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth or both).
