# SimonGameAdHoc

This game is a proof a concept application for the _adhoclib_ [library](https://github.com/gaulthiergain/AdHocLib). 

This application allows a player to create a game and play with other players (or alone if no other device is available). A device can also join a game created by another device. In order to perform this, a choice is performed when launching the game. If the player chooses to create a game, a random color combination is played via an Android animation. Once the animation is over, the user must repeat the sequence in the exact order to win. If it succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. If other players are connected, they received color combinations via wireless communications. Depending on the combination received, the animation is played on each remote device. Then, each player sent its result to the device that hosts the game. Once all the results are received (hosted device knows the number of players by keeping a list up to date), the next colors sequence is launched
