# DistributedCache

This distributed cache application is a proof a concept application for the _adhoclib_ [library](https://github.com/gaulthiergain/AdHocLib). 

It distributes data on several mobile devices. In this case, the application is based on a music sharing on demand. Each device has a list of MP3 songs. Via a search system, devices search and then download songs from other devices. In the case of a multi-hop communication, data that is forwarded by intermediate nodes is also copied temporarily. Consequently, if another device connects to an intermediate node, the cached songs can be obtained quickly.
