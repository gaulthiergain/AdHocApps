# SlidesAdHoc

This slides sharing application is a proof a concept application for the _adhoclib_ [library](https://github.com/gaulthiergain/AdHocLib). 

This application provides a file sharing process between one and several mobile devices. Concretely this case can be illustrated by the following example: a teacher wants to share slides with students via mobile devices. In order to perform this, the teacher launches the application and waits that each student connects. Once a student is connected, he receives and displays the teacherâ€™s current slide. Such a case may seem paradoxical given the ad hoc paradigm, however it shows that the library is also able to handle it. Indeed, an application based on the previous example has been designed. It uses Wi-Fi Direct to handle one-to-many communications.
